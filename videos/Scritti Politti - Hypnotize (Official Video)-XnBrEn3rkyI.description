David Gamson: “Man, I just remember this one took forever. We mixed this for like two weeks at Sarm West with Gary Langan while inhaling fumes from the mannequin factory next door. I might have made that up. Well, I think it was a mannequin factory...” 

Green Gartside: “Fabulous fun with a Fairlight. It would have set you back about £30,000 in those days. We rented one from a guy called Ned Liben who was the company's NY rep. He went on to form Ēbn-Ōzn, who gifted us all with AEIOU And Sometimes Y. I spent much of the time making this album with a stomach-churning sense of inadequacy and lack of self-worth. The rest of the time I felt extraordinarily fortunate to be playing the part of someone whose idle fancies had become a reality.”

Following a reissue process overseen by Green Gartside the band's acclaimed albums Cupid & Psyche 85 and Anomie & Bonhomie are out now on vinyl. You can buy them here: https://scrittipolitti.ffm.to/reissues
