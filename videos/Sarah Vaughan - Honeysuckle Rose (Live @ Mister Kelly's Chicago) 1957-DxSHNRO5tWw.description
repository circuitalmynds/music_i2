"At Mister Kelly's" is a 1957 live album by American jazz singer Sarah Vaughan, recorded at Mister Kelly's jazz club in Chicago. The Allmusic review by John Bush awarded the album four and a half stars and said that At Mister Kelly's captures Vaughan at her "best and most relaxed", stating that "her unerring sense of rhythm carries her through every song on this set, whether the occasion calls for playfulness and wit ("Thou Swell," "Honeysuckle Rose") or a world-wise melancholia ("Willow Weep for Me")". Bush also praises Jimmy Jones and Roy Haynes.

Sarah's accompanied by Jimmy Jones (piano), Richard Davis (bass) & Roy Haynes (drums).  Recorded in Chicago, Illinois, August 6-8, 1957.  (EmArcy Records)
