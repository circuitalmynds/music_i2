Official Audio for "Terra Firma" by Franc Moody

“A week ago we put a rave on in Tottenham, back where it all began for us. It was the first time in a couple of years since we’d put on something like this and fitting that ‘Terra Firma’ was given its first airing. For us the song encapsulates that raw spirit, the energy and decadence of that whole warehouse culture. We definitely tried to bottle that special moment at 5am when sweat is dripping off the walls and the crowd are packed in like sardines. As with all Franc Moody tunes it’s a melting pot of our Lo-Fi, DIY production techniques and ideas, with an added sprinkle of space-age sauce.”
